# README

This code is provided as a record of the data analysis steps reported in the manuscript "More code, less validation: Risk factors for over-reliance on AI coding tools among scientists" (2025). Raw survey data is not published for participant confidentiality so this code is not runnable.

- Data cleaning and filtering by inclusion criteria are implemented in `read_survey.R`
- Variables are transformed for statistical modeling in `transform_`* files (for example, coding responses as ordered factors for Likert-scale survey items)
- Summary statistics and accompanying figures/tables are computed `report_`* files.
- Hypothesis testing and modeling pertaining to factors associated with perceived productivity are in `productivity_factors.R`.


This repository may be updated during the peer review process.
